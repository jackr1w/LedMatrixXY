# WIP - 8x8 and potentially X*Y LED Matrix driver for micro:bit

The makecode extension code is based on https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-neopixel, branched off https://github.com/51bit/colorbit and developed for generic 8x8 WS2812B boards sold on AliExpress, with the intention of updating it to support X*Y boards if it works out.

**Example 8x8 LED Matrix**

## Basic Usage

```blocks

```

Use ``||create||`` with default settings to initialize the LED Matrix.
